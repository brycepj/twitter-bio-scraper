She is a Technology Reporter for the Associated Press in New York covering Social Networking, Social Media, the Internet, Mobile Apps and Online Entertainment. \r\n\r\nShe mostly covers large companies but is interested in start ups. She says that it's always preferable to pitch reporters directly, as editors don't always have time to respond to or even look at pitches. \r\n\r\nShe notes she does NOT write reviews. There is no need to follow up; if she doesn't reply, she's not interested. If you must call, do not call before 4 p.m. EST.",
