It also helps to pinpoint areas where the trend is occurring. She notes that the story must first be important and interesting, since otherwise readers will not care about it. She adds that it can be hard to pitch her aside from her core beats since her coverage changes quite a bit. \r\n\r\nPitches sent to her should reflect the most important information at the top rather than the name of the company. Show her what is newsworthy about the story first, and treat the subject line like a headline. It also helps to show the context of why a pitch is important to her specifically. If you send a broad pitch to a mass e-mail list and there is no personal connection, she will delete it. Pitch \"more scientists when news happens\" and less \"lawyers.\"\r\n\r\nDo NOT send her an email full of jargon. If a pitch is too complex for her, it will be too complex for readers. Pitches should be as short and specific as possible. A few sentences are best. If she replies to your pitch, have other information ready because she needs it quickly. Do NOT say that you need a couple of hours to pull information together, because you should be prepared. \r\n\r\nSending her news that doesn't involve your company is also a bonus because then it looks like you care about the news, not just getting ink. \"We don't write about single companies,\" so pitches should be framed in the context of a larger issue or trend.\r\n\r\nShe suggests looking at her recent stories before pitching. She prefers to be contacted via email. Do NOT call.

Here are a few examples, and here's how my client is involved'...If your firm represents a private equity firm, let me know who they represent and who the contact person is. In a perfect world, a PR person can set me up with one of the managing directors. Any reporter would rather go straight to the source rather than going through a PR person first.

He works from a home office in the San Francisco Bay area. \r\n\r\nHe advises PR professionals to send him information that is relevant to his beat. He is interested in receiving information related to \"off-beat features on cultural and social trends related to technology,\" as well as \"general interest feature ideas.\" He says he often receives information that is unrelated to his areas of coverage and he says such information \"should be directed to the appropriate writers or editors at the newspaper, most of whom are found at its Virginia headquarters.\" \r\n\r\nAll pitches must have a national scope. \"Stories are rarely focused on one person, company or event,\" he says. \"The client should be one of many participating in a national trend. Use your instincts as a reader, not as someone who works for a client. We get a lot of good story ideas, but they are way too local and client focused. You have to pitch the concept behind the client, not the client, to get my attention.\" \r\n\r\nHe asks PR professionals not to send him \"pitches to profile one company, or one executive.\" Those types of pitches are more appropriate for the Money section, he says. \"Get to know the publication before you pitch and understand the national slant of USA Today,\" he says. \"Just because something is of great regional interest, it doesn't mean it would rivet a national audience. Ask yourself, if you're a Californian, if your great-aunt in Kalamazoo would love to read the story.\" \r\n\r\nWhen working with PR professionals, he prefers to be contacted by email with no follow-ups. He does NOT accept faxes.","Facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/marco.dellacava.7","LinkedIn":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/marco-della-cava/3b/522/209","Other":"","Google+":"","Pinterest":"","Twitter":"http://twitter.com/marcodellacava","YouTube":"","Outlet":"USA Today - San Francisco Bureau","Media Type":"Daily Newspaper Bureau","Type code":"1","Outlet Topic":"News","City":"San Francisco","State":"California","Circulation":"","DMA Rank":"6","MSA Rank":"13"},{"Unique Visitors Per Month":"","Salutation":"Ms.","First Name":"Marisa","Last Name":"Brahney","Email":"mbrahney@news12.com","Phone":"+1 (732) 346-3270","Contact Title":"Anchor/Reporter","Contact Topic":"News","Contact Profile":"Brahney investigates and covers a wide range of topics as a Reporter for News 12 New Jersey during weekday newscasts.
