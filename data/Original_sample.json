It also helps to pinpoint areas where the trend is occurring. She notes that the story must first be important and interesting, since otherwise readers will not care about it. She adds that it can be hard to pitch her aside from her core beats since her coverage changes quite a bit. \r\n\r\nPitches sent to her should reflect the most important information at the top rather than the name of the company. Show her what is newsworthy about the story first, and treat the subject line like a headline. It also helps to show the context of why a pitch is important to her specifically. If you send a broad pitch to a mass e-mail list and there is no personal connection, she will delete it. Pitch \"more scientists when news happens\" and less \"lawyers.\"\r\n\r\nDo NOT send her an email full of jargon. If a pitch is too complex for her, it will be too complex for readers. Pitches should be as short and specific as possible. A few sentences are best. If she replies to your pitch, have other information ready because she needs it quickly. Do NOT say that you need a couple of hours to pull information together, because you should be prepared. \r\n\r\nSending her news that doesn't involve your company is also a bonus because then it looks like you care about the news, not just getting ink. \"We don't write about single companies,\" so pitches should be framed in the context of a larger issue or trend.\r\n\r\nShe suggests looking at her recent stories before pitching.

Here are a few examples, and here's how my client is involved'...If your firm represents a private equity firm, let me know who they represent and who the contact person is. In a perfect world, a PR person can set me up with one of the managing directors. Any reporter would rather go straight to the source rather than going through a PR person first.

You have to pitch the concept behind the client, not the client, to get my attention.\" \r\n\r\nHe asks PR professionals not to send him \"pitches to profile one company, or one executive.\" Those types of pitches are more appropriate for the Money section, he says. \"Get to know the publication before you pitch and understand the national slant of USA Today,\" he says. \"Just because something is of great regional interest, it doesn't mean it would rivet a national audience.
